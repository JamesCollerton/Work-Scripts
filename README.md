# Work Scripts

These are a set of scripts I made for fun to use at work, they do things like call my phone and send me emails.

There are basically three main pieces of functionality:

- The first one is used to call my phone from the command line with a dummy number. If someone is annoying me at my desk I run it and pretend it is a client call. 'Oh sorry mate! I'd love to hear more about that, but duty calls...'

- The second one is used to automatically fill my inbox with impressive looking emails. I use it when my boss comes over to my desk. I run it and it fills my inbox with stuff like 'Congrats on the great work', 'We're all really impressed with the work you're doing'. I just leave my Outlook open and they can read it over my shoulder while I pretend I haven't noticed.

- The last one automatically composes and sends 'late for meeting' emails. It uses the Transport for London REST API and scans for any tube lines that are delayed. Then it automatically creates an email saying I'm on that tube and I'm running late.

Use them wisely!
